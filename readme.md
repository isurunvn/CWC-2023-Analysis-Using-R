- [`dplyr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html): For data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs to solve common data manipulation challenges.
- [`ggplot2`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html): For creating complex and multi-layered visualizations based on The Grammar of Graphics.
- [`RColorBrewer`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RColorBrewer/index.html): For providing color schemes for maps and other graphics.
- [`tidyr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/index.html): For reshaping and tidying the data, making it easier to work with and analyze.

You can install these packages using the following commands:

```r
install.packages("readr")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("ggplot2")
